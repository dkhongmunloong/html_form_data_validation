# html_form_data_validation
A project to showcase how html form validation is done using javascript and jQuery for fashion details form

1. In this assignment, create the “Add Product” form for the admin to add a new Fashion product into the system. The perspective of the assignment is to create a new Add Product form for the web admin to add a new Fashion product to the database, the assignment focuses on JavaScript and HTML to create such form.
2. The HTML file allows the user to provide data inside the respective textbox input controls. When the user clicks the Submit button control, the client-side JavaScript logic will begin inspecting all fields to find out which field has empty data. Detect the field that has empty data and output messages to inform the user to indicate an option or filled up the field.
3. Include a div element, divMessage into the web form. eg "div id="divMessage"
4. Proper help messages should be displayed in the div element, divMessage. For example, if the user provides no data input for Model Name, Product Type, Warranty, Size, Price and Available From, the JavaScript will display messages such as:
• Model Name is required.
• Product Type is required.
• Warranty is required.
• Size is required.
• Price is required.
• Available From is required.
Only the field for package description is optional. Display error message corresponding to the field not populated.
